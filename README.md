* Uniques
  * Thalassocracy of the South [Hellenic League]
  >Contrary to popular belief, Tondo didn't maintain it's realm by traditional feudal rules, instead their governance is styled around the formation and maintenance of strategic alliances and unions with other citystates along the Philippines and the Pasig River.
  
  * Maharlika [Replaces Swordsman]
  >An austerely martial class in the hierarchy of the Tagalogs. Their noble status and position in Tondo's society is maintained by their mastery of martial arts and warfare along the coasts and forests of the Philippines.
  
  * Wet Farm
  >The Tagalogs maintained and adopted an agricultural society based around the cultivation of Wet Farming products and techniques. Allowing their descendants to live in the island-riddled Philippines in habitable fashion.
